[comment]: <> (Microsoft telemetry and App Center APIs are used to collect information about the app crashes, errors, and user interaction inside the app for diagnostics and analytical purposes. A log file is generated to store logs such as errors, warnings, and other information. Of these four types, only the error information are collected using the App Center API. Users can manually email the log file with all the details to the developer for diagnostics purposes.)
