### Privacy Policy
The app requires access to user File System to execute the apps core functionalities (as a file manager). Users can enable the file access from: ```Windows 10(X) Settings -> Privacy -> File System -> Toggle On File Access for Shrestha Files.```

Microsoft telemetry and App Center APIs in the app may collect information about the app crashes and usage for diagnostics and analytical purposes. A log file is generated to store logs such as errors, warnings, and other information. However, the file is not tranmitted outside the users device. Users can send the log for diagnostic purposes.
