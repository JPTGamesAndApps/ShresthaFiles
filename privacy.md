### Privacy Policy

#### We take users' privacy very seriously! We understand the importance of clearly communicating the users' privacy policy.

The app do not collect any user identifiable information!

* Windows 10 File System Access
  * The app requires access to Windows 10 File System to execute the app's core functionalities (as a file manager). Users can enable the file access from: ```Windows 10(X) Settings -> Privacy -> File System -> Toggle On File Access for Shrestha Files.```
  * Shrestha Files does not transmit any user files or folders outside users' computer. (Note that this excludes the user initiated actions such as when a user is copying files/folders to the network locations themselves).
 

* Internet Access
  * The app requires access to the internet for the following purposes.
    * App Update: The app checks for an updated version at the app launch. Checking for the update and downloading the updates require internet access.
    * License Check: The app connects to Microsoft Store to check the app purchase status to enable or disable paid features.
    * Microsoft adds telemetry apps to all UWP apps to collect statistics about app such as acquisitions and launches. It also generates dump files when the app crashes which are also transmitted to a Microsoft Server. It also collects non-identifying user data such as the country, device model, and the operating system version.
    * Microsoft Visual Studio App Center APIs are used to collect crash information and analytics to understand the errors, crashes, and users behaviors within the app. For example, the analytics can enable users to know the most popular colorful theme. It can help the developer understand what led to an app crash. The error logs (but not warning, performance, or info message logs) shown in the Log Viewer are also sent to the App Center.

* Clipboard Access
  * The app checks for clipboard inforamtion to enable or disable paste option in the context menu.
