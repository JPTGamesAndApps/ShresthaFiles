## Why Microsoft Has Not Updated Windows File Explorer To Meet Fluent Design Language Yet? ##

(Let’s start by stating that this is solely an opinion piece.)

Windows File Explorer has evolved over time — bringing a lot of new features and improvements. As Windows File Explorer (or its predecessor) is built right into every version of Windows, and almost every Windows users knows it. It is reliable, robust, and meets needs of most of the users for most of the purposes. However, sometimes it also feels like an abandoned piece of software.

Microsoft Windows have evolved significantly over time. Especially with the introduction of Windows 8 and then Windows 10, the design language of the entire operating system has evolved significantly. However, many critical built in tools (or inbox apps) were left as they were. This includes the classic Control Panel and Windows File Explorer.

While Microsoft did introduce Settings app to replace Control Panel, it was many years before Settings was able to replace Control Panel for any significant task. And even now, Settings app has not completely replaced the classic Control Panel. But, at least Settings was introduced fairly early in the development of Windows 10, and there has been a significant progress over last several years. Maybe Microsoft worked on Settings app first because it is one of the main built in tools in other operating systems (such as Android and iOS). Or, maybe because most of the users would not use Control Panel often. Or, maybe because parts of Control Panel can be moved to Settings at a time with the eventual goal of fully replacing Control Panel. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Windows File Explorer.

Windows File Explorer is an essential part of Windows operating system. Partial replacement of Windows File Explorer is not possible. And, compared to the Control Panel, most of the Windows users are likely to use it much more often. Not being able to update a wallpaper may not cause chaos, but failing to copy files and folders definitely will.

This does not mean that Windows File Explorer has not evolved at all, it has! Microsoft just have not released a full replacement for Windows File Explorer. Microsoft has started to include some modern components in the classic Windows File Explorer. For example, search box shows suggestions in modern-ish user interface that is likely coming from XAML code.

But, it still has classic user interface. It still uses ribbon interface which was probably first introduced in Microsoft Office 2007 or so. It’s still tightly coupled with Control panel — so much so that some of the folder options affect both Control Panel and Windows File Explorer. It still has old school context menu, and so forth.

Windows is well known for backward compatibility. You can still run majority of apps developed for Windows 8.1, 7, XP, NT, and possibly 3.1. However, such backward compatibility also comes at a cost. One of the result of the backward compatibility is that the legacy version of various built in apps cannot be significantly altered. So, what could be the solution? Maybe, just like Settings is installed alongside Control Panels, a new Windows File Explorer should be installed alongside the classic Windows File Explorer. Maybe that’s what the One Drive focused File Explorer for Windows 10X intends to do. Or, maybe One Drive focused File Explorer is solely for Windows 10X and not for Windows 10. Maybe, a new version of Windows File Explorer will be or is being developed for Windows 10. In any case, a number of improvements can be made to Windows File Explorer so that it fits the modern and fluent interface introduced in Windows 10 and it meets the evolving needs of Windows users.

In the next article, I will try to pinpoint some of the features that a modern File explorer should offer. These should be useful whether Microsoft or other third-parties are developing a new File Explorer or updating an existing ones.
